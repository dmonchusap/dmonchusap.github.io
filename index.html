                Hi! I am an aspiring product manager based in Orange County, CA, interested in how user empathy and analytics can be applied to design solutions that solve hard problems and deliver value and delight to customers.  I get excited seeing things that are aesthetically pleasing but can also solve problems.
                <br>
                My industry experience includes financial services and dental, but I am eager to explore avenues in gaming, technolgy, and arts & entertainment. I value a design and empathy based approach regarding researching and ideating creative solutions to solve user pain.  The user's perspective is extremely important to me when trying to solve their problems.
                <br>
                My downtime is spent scrolling through Twitter, salting scrubs in Overwatch, and capturing moments in photos. My current musical infatuation lies with Madeon and Lemaitre.  Talk to me about coffee, Tsum Tsums, Gudetama, and steel water bottles.  I enjoy traveling, and I recently returned from the Philippines and Japan.  Next on my list is Norway.
                </p>
                <h2>My skills and proficiences include the following...</h2>
